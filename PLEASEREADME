Welcome to our repository for the Carbon Capture Unit Project

The goal of this project was to assemble a device to measure various quantities to quantify the air quality in real time. The main features of this device are its probability, data capture capabilities and real time display. 

The Air Quality Monitor (AQM) measures CO2 ppm, PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations (in ug/m^3) as well as qualitative volatility organic compound level (VOC) and temperature/humidity levels. It all comes together with an Arduino Nano to send the data to an SD card through a Arduino module. At the same time the data is sent in real time to an LCD display.

All of the codes and libraries used to complete this project are available above.
