# Welcome to our repository for the Carbon Capture Unit and Air Quality Monitor Project

The goal of this project was to assemble a device to measure various quantities to quantify the air quality in real time. The main features of this device are its portability, data capture capabilities and real time display. 

The Air Quality Monitor (AQM) measures CO2 ppm, PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations (in ug/m^3) as well as qualitative volatility organic compound level (VOC) and temperature(ÂºC)/humidity(%) levels. It all comes together with an Arduino Nano to send the data to an SD card through a Arduino module. At the same time the data is sent in real time to an LCD display.

The Carbon Capture Unit. is powered by an Arduino Nano which controls a fan, a DHT22 temeprature and humidity sensor and a humidifer. 

All of the codes and libraries used to complete this project are available above.
